# Heartbeat

1. Isolate/identify the core principles for your group.
   <br>_Transparency? Shared mission? Accountability?_
2. Weekly heartbeat checks are sent every Friday morning. Or whatever.
   <br>_Aim for something that can be completed in ten seconds. Will prompt each member to rate their experience with each principle for each interval._
3. Share the data every Monday morning, and follow the conversations.
   <br>_The data is a conversation-starter. [Keanu Reeves voice] Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you._

This is importantly not about any single group collecting data, interpreting it, and distributing an interpretation. It’s about aggregating data and keeping the group self-informed, facilitating self-improvement and growth.

To do that, we keep things simple. Just a couple numbers. Generate some useful derivatives, and let the conversation run from there. Open-ended.
